# Vuenify - A Simple CRUD Application (Technical Exam)
This project features a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, PrimeVue, PrimeFlex, and PrimeIcons. The application allows users to input a contact's name and email, store the details locally, and displays saved contacts in a table
Features:

    Create: Add a new contact with their name and email.
    Read: Display a list of all stored contacts (temporary and saved).
    Update: Edit the details of a saved contact.
    Delete: Remove a contact from the saved list.
The Home page shows a form to input the contact details, a table to display newly added contacts. All contacts shown on the table are temporary and will disappear upon refresh.
The Saved Contacts page shows a table of all saved/added contacts stored locally. Contacts can be edited and deleted.
